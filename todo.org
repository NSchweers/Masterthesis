* DONE rewrite, implement and test new grammar for floats (3 days)
* DONE rewrite, implement and test code for non decimal bases (6 days)
  - #b0101
  - #o0715
  - #xFF
  - #NNr... -> bases 2-36
* TODO write a test which reads in the complete elisp codebase (1 day, optional)
  Do this with the original reader and my own, then check for differences with
  `tree-equal'. 
* DONE write some more on the algorithms which are used. (3 days)
  Possibly write something on my recursive descent parser, as itâ€™s quite
  declarative (even though no macros were used).
  - Write on dotted pair notation
  - Write on circular reads
  - Write on interpreting numbers
* DONE describe the used datastructures (also on how macro chars relate to their functions
* DONE shorten long names (el-reader/foo or el-reader//foo to foo).
* DONE clear up references and other todo notes in the thesis (3 days)
* TODO document the API, including differences to the CL API (3 days)
* TODO Write something on the future of this project. (1 day)
* TODO write something on lisp evaluation (1 day)
* TODO write something on extending Emacs with C modules (3 days)
  Why it has not been done yet.
* TODO clear up formatting and typography (2 days)
* TODO give it to wilhelm and manuel for proof-reading (3 days).
* TODO print it and hand it in (1 day)
* TODO write a test case for the following scenario:
  A read macro calls read on a different stream as toplevel.  Both streams
  include object references with the same numbers.  

  This can (hopefully) be fixed by letting each toplevel call to read rebind
  el-reader//*read-objects* to nil.
* TODO (optionally) write a TeX macro
  automatically link any mention of a function (or add a page number). 
* TODO define getch in terms of peek-char, not the other way around!
