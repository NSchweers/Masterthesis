* Introduction
** Lisp History
   - 1960: McCarthy devised a representation of functions based on lambda
     calculus.
   - Programs as lists with symbols.
   - prefix notation.
   - Syntax on top was planned, never implemented.
   - McCarthy’s student S.R. Russell handcoded ‘eval’ in machine language, hence
     an interpreter was born.
